# Beefy-V-Core-3
The following repository contains all of the modifications I have created to build a 600mm X 600mm X 500mm Ratrig V-Core 3!
First Published 03/10/2022

Objective: we set out with the objective to build a custom V-Core 3 that would be capable of printing full size engine components such as cylinder heads, intake manifolds, and accessory bracketry, all in the name of research and development. 

Here, you will find all of the .STEP and STL files for the models I have developed either from scratch, or as a remix of existing models. I will attempt to give credit where credit is due for remixes. If I have missed your recognition by chance, please reach out and let me know.
